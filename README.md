# Weather App

Welcome to the Weather App repository! This project is a personal endeavor to develop a weather application that utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the current weather of a city. Additionally, the app incorporates Google's Geolocation API to obtain the geographical position of a user and display the corresponding weather information.

## Project Overview

The Weather App is designed to provide users with up-to-date weather data for any desired location. By leveraging the OpenWeatherMap API, the app retrieves real-time weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions. Additionally, with the integration of Google's Geolocation API, the app can determine the user's current location and provide the relevant weather data.

## Project Highlights

- **OpenWeatherMap API**: The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve accurate and current weather data for a specified city. This integration allows users to obtain essential weather information for their desired locations.

- **Google's Geolocation API**: By leveraging Google's Geolocation API, the app can determine the geographical position of the user and display the weather information based on their current location. This functionality enhances the user experience by providing personalized weather updates.

## How to Use the Weather App

To use the Weather App effectively, follow these steps:

1. Access the application.
2. Enter the name of the desired city in the search field.
3. Click the "Search" button or press "Enter" to retrieve the weather information for the specified city.
4. Alternatively, you can allow the app to detect your current location by clicking the "Use Current Location" button.
